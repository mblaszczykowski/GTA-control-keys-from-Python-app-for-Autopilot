# Python script that controls keys for games like GTA V
> This app lets you to control keys in GTA V when regular pyautogui module did not work for this game, you can use it for ML/AI stuff like Autopilot to play with this and other games.

## Technologies
- Python 3.9
- Python `ctypes` module


## Usage
Open GTA V or other game and run this script as administrator.

I tested this script for automated take off of the plane, so I got into plane on airport, moved to runway and run this script. You can use it for any activity like playing with OpenCV and self-driving cars in GTA. It just handles keys, which most of modules cannot with GTA V.
